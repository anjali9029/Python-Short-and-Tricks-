Hello Readers, here we learn some sort tricks of python. 
Some very basic things of python which is most important for any python program.
Now, Lets start our Learning porcesses............


#First lets see Line, Multiline and Identations Statements

#for the single line comment we are using (#)
#Line
print("Hello, World")  # this is the single line of code in python


"""for multiple line
comment we are using ("""""") three quotes"""
#Multiline 

#here we are using square bracakets for the adding multiple line code
total = [1+2+3+        
         4+3+2]

#Here we are using blackslash for the multiline code
total1 = 1+2+3+\
3+2+2

#Here we are using prentheses (round brackets) for the multiline code
total2 = (3+2+3+
          3+2)

print(total)
print(total1)
print(total2)

#Indentations

if True:
    print("This is an Identation")
    print("This is an Identation")       #Here the whitespace is called identation
print("This is not an Identation")



#Output
